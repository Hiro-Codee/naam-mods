  <title>Rules for the moderators</title>

  <h1>Below are a few rules for you powerhungry peasants :|</h1>
  <br />
  <h4>
  <ol>
  <li>All the rules in the RULES room apply to you as well, with the exception of the last one. So yes, even you guys can get banned if you misbehave. And I expect you guys to read the RULES room carefully.</li>
  <li>Do not take this mod shield for granted. You can very well lose it if I see that you don't deserve it.</li>
  <li>Don't ban people for fun. There are other ways to make fun. You can kick someone for fun but keep it limited; don't annoy them.</li>
  <li>You are free to choose for how long you want to ban someone when they misbehave, with the sole exception of crossteaming; in that case, ban them for maximum 1 week, not more. And if they crossteamed more than 1 week ago, then ban them for maximum 1 day. You can only ban someone for crossteaming if you have solid proof, in the form of a recording; NOT with witnesses.</li>
  <li>Don't badmouth people when you ban them. Just ban them and don't talk badly about them/rub it in after you do so. And don't create drama before/after banning someone. I expect the moderators to be mature people.</li>
  <li>Don't undo other moderator bans. If you think a ban is unjustified, talk about it with the moderator in question in private or in the mods room; NOT in any of the public rooms. Do not write stuff like: "why did you ban them?" in any of the public rooms. That moderator is also free to hide their reasons from you. They are not obliged to tell you. It is enough that they give me the reason. But I would highly appreciate it when you briefly explain your reason in the mods room.</li>
  <li>Try to keep the drama as small as possible. Don't get involved in problems of other moderators if there is no need to. If someone tries to involve you into a problem with another moderator, be neutral and tell them that they should discuss it with that moderator. I don't want you to pick a side.</li>
  <li>The main job of a moderator is to keep this chat a peaceful, calm place. So you will have to do stuff like: calm people down, minimize the dramas, bring order when there is chaos, etc... while still keeping your calm and friendly, but just attitude. Moderators should be such people that earn respect from others through their behaviour. If you can do these things, you have proven yourself to be a good moderator.</li>
  </ol>
